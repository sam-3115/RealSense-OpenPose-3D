# ðŸŽ¯ Camera Coordinate System & Origin
# ðŸŽ¯Measurement Verification Using RealSense Depth Camera
---
## ðŸ§  Overview
This document explains how the **Intel RealSense Depth Camera** defines its **3D coordinate system**, how the **origin** is placed, and how image coordinates (pixels) relate to real-world 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z).

Understanding this relationship is essential for correctly converting OpenPose 2D keypoints into real 3D positions.

## ðŸ§­ Coordinate System in Intel RealSense

## ðŸ§© Concepts Covered

- Intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters  
- Field of view (FOV) and focal length  
- Depth alignment and registration  
- Projection from image (u,v) to world (X,Y,Z) coordinates  
- Transformations between **camera**, **depth**, and **world** coordinate frames

---

## ðŸ§  Use in This Project
This coordinate system was used to:
- Align OpenPose 2D keypoints with depth data.  
- Convert 2D skeletons to accurate 3D joint positions.  
- Visualize the human body skeleton in real-world space.
